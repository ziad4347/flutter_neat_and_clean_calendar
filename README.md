# flutter_neat_and_clean_calendar

![Repo Card](https://github.com/rwbr/flutter_neat_and_clean_calendar/blob/main/img/github-repo-card.png)

Simple flutter calendar based on [flutter_clean_calendar](https://github.com/pmcarlos/flutter_clean_calendar) package.
This package offers some extra functionality. It introduced a new **NeatCleanCalendarEvent** object, that gets used as the data component transfered the calendar widget as a parameter. So it is possible now to color the dots in the **Calendartiles** with a color corresponding to the event. 

The event list below the calendar view is generated bei the package. Here the extra data of the **NetCleanCalendarEvent** objects again come into play. 

The package is highly customizable.

The calendar view shows a list of events for the selected date. This list view supports **three different types of events:**

* Single day event (starts and ends at certain time on a single day)
* All-day events (Span over a full day with no specific start and end time, property `isAllDay`)
* Multi-day events (Start at a specific time on one day and end at a specific time on another day, property `isMultiDay`)

![Event types](https://github.com/rwbr/flutter_neat_and_clean_calendar/blob/main/img/different-events.png)

The property `isAllDay` has a higher priority than 'isMultiDay'. This means, that when you set `isAllDay` to `true` for an event, it will show up in the events list als all-day event without start and end times, no matter if `isMultiDay` was also set to `true`.

You can include images in calendar events. The property `icon` takes a String of the image name. This parameter is optional. 

To control the width of the image you can use the property `wide`, which is a bool. 

## Usage

Embed the 'Calendar' widget in a column. Below the calendar (as the second widget in the Column) place a 'ListView.builder' widget for rendereing the list of events.

## Sample event data

The syntax of the event map changed due to the introduction of the 'NeatCleanCalendarEvent' class.

```dart
final List<NeatCleanCalendarEvent> _eventList = [
  NeatCleanCalendarEvent('MultiDay Event A',
      startTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
          DateTime.now().day, 10, 0),
      endTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
          DateTime.now().day + 2, 12, 0),
      color: Colors.orange,
      isMultiDay: true),
  NeatCleanCalendarEvent('Allday Event B',
      startTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
          DateTime.now().day - 2, 14, 30),
      endTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
          DateTime.now().day + 2, 17, 0),
      color: Colors.pink,
      isAllDay: true),
  NeatCleanCalendarEvent('Normal Event D',
      startTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
          DateTime.now().day, 14, 30),
      endTime: DateTime(DateTime.now().year, DateTime.now().month,
          DateTime.now().day, 17, 0),
      color: Colors.indigo),
];
```

**CAUTION**: from v0.3.0 on the preferred way to set the calendar events is to provide a list (property `eventsList`). You can still use a map (property `events`) to do this, but this functionality is **DEPRECATED** and will get **removed from v0.4.0 on**.

## Examples

### Basic widget with customized colors

Some colors were cutomized in this example:

```dart
Calendar(
  eventDoneColor: Colors.green,
  selectedColor: Colors.pink,
  todayColor: Colors.blue,
  eventColor: Colors.grey,
)
```

### Display a date picker to jump to a certain date

```dart
Calendar(
  datePickerType: DatePickerType.date
)
```
These options are available:
* 'DatePickerType.date'
* 'DatePickerType.year'
* 'DatePickerType.hidden'

If you set the option to 'DatePickerType.date' or 'DatePickerType.year' an icon to load the date picker is shown.

![Jump-To-Date button](img/jump-date-button.png)

Pressing this button opens a date picker, that allows the user to jump to a certain date.

If you set the option to 'DatePickerType.hidden' no icon is displaysed. This logic replaces the option 'isJumpDateButtonEnabled' which was present in earlier releases.

### Handling all-day events

The class `NeatAndCleanCalendarEvent` has a boolean property called √¨sAllDay`. This property allows you to 
define events, that last all day with now start or end time. These events get sorted at the top of the 
events list.

![All day event at the top of the list](img/all-day-event.png)

With the property `allDayEventText` you define the string displayed for that type of events. If you
don't set this option the calendar will display `All day` for these events.

### Expandable calendar view

```dart
Calendar(
  isExpandable: true;
)
```

### Custom day builder


```dart
Calendar(
  // A builder function that renders each calendar tile how you'd like.
  dayBuilder: (BuildContext context, DateTime day) {
      return new Text("!");
  },
)
```

### Custom event list builder


```dart
Calendar(
  // A builder function that renders the event list
  eventListBuilder: (BuildContext context,
      List<NeatCleanCalendarEvent> _selectesdEvents) {
    return new Text("!");
  },
)
```
